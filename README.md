How to predict Loan Default using Machine Learning Models




Question: Can you predict if an applicant will default the loan or not in the future?


Problem Statement : 

MyHom is a finance company that lends housing loans at the best and most affordable interest rates to customers. In recent times, the company incurred heavy losses due to loan defaults. Most applicants failed to repay the loan as per the promissory note.

In order to avoid such losses, the company has decided to build a system for identifying the loan defaulters automatically based on data. This will help the company to identify the potential applicants and ensure the smooth running of the entire process.

Now, the company challenges the Data Science community to build a smart AI system to predict the probability of an applicant defaulting the loan or not in the future.

To summarize: In Data Science terms ,this problem falls into the category of "Binary Classification" problem in which the target variable (Loan Default) (Which we are supposed to predict) can have two values ("Yes" OR "No")

Training dataset : It consists of details of the customer (like Age, Asset Cost , No.of loans, No.of Current loans,Education, Loan Amount and others.) along with the target column which is Loan_Default with values :  0 & 1 

Test Dataset : It consists of similar details for new customers ( like Age, Asset Cost , No.of loans, No.of Current loans,Education, Loan Amount and others), however without the target column (i.e. Loan_Default) Using the training dataset we need to prepare a Machine Learning model which will predict the Loan_Default for the customers in the test dataset  (i.e. For each customer in the test dataset predict whether the loan a will get defaulted or not)
